<p align="justify">

The DATA file containing the reknown and long-studied **Fisher's Iris data set** have been downloaded from [www.archive.ics.uci.edu](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/). Converted it in a .txt format, the information appears to be structured so that a comma separates individual items and each record is on a new line which is the standard pattern of a CSV tabular disposition. Therefore, I have proceed to import it as such in Python and opened it with the **Pandas** module accordingly
